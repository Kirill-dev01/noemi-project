# NOÃ‰MI Website Layout

This is a diploma project focused on creating an adaptive blog website layout for "NOÃ‰MI," built strictly according to provided .psd design mockups using pure HTML and CSS.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For creating semantically correct and structured markup.
- **CSS3**: For styling all page elements.
- **Flexbox**: Used for the entire grid structure, from main columns to galleries.
- **JavaScript (native)**: A few lines of code to implement pop-up window interactivity.

## âœ¨ Key Features
- **Semantic Markup**: Utilizes `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`, and other tags to enhance accessibility and SEO.
- **Relative Paths**: All resource paths (fonts, images) are relative, ensuring full project portability.
- **Local Fonts**: Fonts (Oswald, Open Sans) are connected locally using the `@font-face` rule.
- **Pop-up Window**: A modal window with a contact form, triggered by clicking the "Contacts" menu item.
- **Custom Form Elements**: Styled radio buttons and select elements to match the design.
- **Pixel-Perfect Design**: All sizes, margins, colors, and fonts are meticulously aligned with the PSD mockup.
